# Shape-Tester
Java program that lets the user calculate the area of a rectangle. Created while learning Java to practice using inheritance and to 
practice Object Oriented Programming. 

This program uses 3 separate files. The file named 'Rectangle.java' creates a Rectangle object and uses getter and setter methods to 
set the length and width of the rectangle shape. This file also extends the file named 'Shape.java' which 
prints out the phrase "I am a shape". 
The "ShapeTester.java' file then creates a new Rectangle object with a set length and width then uses the calculateArea() function from 'Rectangle.java" to calculate the area of the new Rectangle object.
